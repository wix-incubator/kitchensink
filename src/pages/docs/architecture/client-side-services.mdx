# Client-Side Services & Headless Components Architecture

This document explains the core architecture pattern used throughout the Wix Kitchensink project. This pattern separates business logic from UI presentation through a combination of **Client-Side Services** and **Headless Components**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Client-Side Services

Client-side services are reactive state containers that:

- **Encapsulate State**: Use Signals for reactive state management
- **Handle Business Logic**: Contain domain-specific operations and transformations
- **Manage Side Effects**: Handle API calls, validations, and external integrations
- **Provide Clean APIs**: Expose clear, functional interfaces for UI consumption

```typescript
// Example service structure
export const MyService = implementService.withConfig<ConfigType>()(
  MyServiceDefinition,
  ({ getService, config }) => {
    const signalsService = getService(SignalsServiceDefinition);

    // Reactive state
    const state: Signal<StateType> = signalsService.signal(initialState);

    // Business logic
    const updateState = (newData: StateType) => {
      state.set(newData);
    };

    return {
      state,
      updateState,
      // ... other API methods
    };
  }
);
```

### 2. Headless Components

Headless components are React components that:

- **Use Render Props**: Accept children as functions that receive data and actions
- **Expose Service Data**: Provide reactive access to service state
- **Handle No UI**: Focus purely on data and behavior, not presentation
- **Enable Composition**: Can be mixed and matched for different UI needs

```typescript
// Example headless component
export const MyHeadlessComponent = (props: {
  children: (data: ComponentData) => React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const service = useService(MyServiceDefinition);
  const data = service.state.get();

  return props.children({
    data,
    actions: {
      update: service.updateState,
    },
  });
};
```

### 3. UI Composition

The final UI is composed by combining headless components with presentation logic:

```tsx
<MyHeadlessComponent>
  {({ data, actions }) => (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => actions.update(newData)}>Update</button>
    </div>
  )}
</MyHeadlessComponent>
```

## Benefits

### Separation of Concerns

- **Business Logic**: Lives in services, independent of UI
- **State Management**: Handled reactively with Signals
- **UI Presentation**: Focused purely on rendering and user interaction

### Reusability

- **Services**: Can be used across different UI implementations
- **Headless Components**: Provide flexible data access patterns
- **UI Components**: Can be easily swapped or customized

### Testability

- **Services**: Can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies
- **Headless Components**: Easy to test with mock render functions
- **UI Components**: Can focus on presentation logic only

### Maintainability

- **Clear Boundaries**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Predictable Patterns**: Consistent architecture across features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the stack

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Configuration

Services accept configuration through factory functions:

```typescript
// Server-side configuration loading
export async function loadMyServiceConfig(): Promise<ServiceConfig> {
  const data = await fetchInitialData();
  return { initialData: data };
}

// Usage in Astro pages
const serviceConfig = await loadMyServiceConfig();
```

### Service Dependencies

Services can depend on other services through the `getService` function:

```typescript
export const MyService = implementService.withConfig<ConfigType>()(
  MyServiceDefinition,
  ({ getService, config }) => {
    // Depend on other services
    const otherService = getService(OtherServiceDefinition);

    // Use dependent service in logic
    const performAction = () => {
      otherService.doSomething();
    };

    return { performAction };
  }
);
```

### Server Integration

For server-only operations, services use Astro Actions:

```typescript
// actions.ts
export const myActions = {
  serverAction: defineAction({
    handler: async (input) => {
      // Server-only logic using auth.elevate etc.
      return await processOnServer(input);
    },
  }),
};

// Service receives actions through config
export const MyService = implementService.withConfig<{
  myActions: typeof myActions;
}>()(MyServiceDefinition, ({ config }) => {
  const performServerAction = async () => {
    await config.myActions.serverAction(data);
  };

  return { performServerAction };
});
```

## Service Manager Setup

All services must be registered with a `ServicesManager`:

```tsx
import { ServicesManagerProvider } from "@wix/services-manager-react";
import {
  createServicesManager,
  createServicesMap,
} from "@wix/services-manager";

<ServicesManagerProvider
  servicesManager={createServicesManager(
    createServicesMap()
      .addService(ServiceDefinition, Service, serviceConfig)
      .addService(AnotherServiceDefinition, AnotherService, anotherConfig)
  )}
>
  {/* Your UI components */}
</ServicesManagerProvider>;
```

## Best Practices

### Service Design

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain area
2. **Immutable Updates**: Always create new state objects
3. **Clear APIs**: Expose only what UI components need
4. **Error Handling**: Include error states in service APIs

### Headless Component Design

1. **Atomic Components**: Keep components small and focused
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
3. **Type Safety**: Export comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
4. **Reactive Data**: Always expose reactive values from signals

### UI Integration

1. **Composition**: Build complex UIs from simple headless components
2. **Separation**: Keep business logic in services, not UI components
3. **Performance**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Framework Philosophy

This architecture was designed around these principles:

1. **Developer Experience**: Predictable patterns and excellent TypeScript support
2. **Performance**: Reactive updates only affect components that need re-rendering
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between business logic and presentation
4. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap UI implementations or extend functionality

The result is a robust, scalable architecture that makes building complex applications with Wix both productive and enjoyable.
