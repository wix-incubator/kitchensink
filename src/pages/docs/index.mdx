# Wix Kitchensink Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Wix Kitchensink project. This documentation covers our headless component architecture, client-side services, and implementation patterns.

## Documentation Sections

### Architecture & Patterns

- [**Client-Side Services & Headless Components**](/docs/architecture/client-side-services) - Core architecture patterns
- [**Service Dependencies**](/docs/architecture/service-dependencies) - How services work together
- [**Server-Side Integration**](/docs/architecture/server-integration) - Astro Actions integration

### Headless Components

#### Member Management

- [**CurrentMemberProfile**](/docs/components/current-member-profile) - Display member information
- [**PhotoUpload Components**](/docs/components/photo-upload) - File upload functionality
- [**ProfileUpdate Components**](/docs/components/profile-update) - Profile editing

### Client-Side Services

#### Core Services

- [**CurrentMemberService**](/docs/services/current-member-service) - Member state management
- [**PhotoUploadService**](/docs/services/photo-upload-service) - File upload state & logic
- [**ProfileUpdateService**](/docs/services/profile-update-service) - Profile update state & logic

### Examples & Use Cases

- [**Members Page Implementation**](/docs/examples/members-page) - Complete page example
- [**Composition Patterns**](/docs/examples/composition-patterns) - How to combine components
- [**Testing Strategies**](/docs/examples/testing) - Testing headless components

## Getting Started

If you're new to this architecture, we recommend starting with:

1. [**Client-Side Services & Headless Components**](/docs/architecture/client-side-services) - Understanding the core concepts
2. [**CurrentMemberProfile**](/docs/components/current-member-profile) - Simple display components
3. [**Members Page Implementation**](/docs/examples/members-page) - See it all working together

## Key Principles

### Separation of Concerns

- **Services**: Handle state and business logic
- **Headless Components**: Provide reactive data via render props
- **UI Components**: Handle only presentation and user interaction

### Reactive State Management

- Uses **Signals** for automatic UI updates
- Headless components expose reactive data from services
- UI components receive data through render prop patterns

### Composability

- Mix and match headless components for different UIs
- Services can be combined using `ServicesManagerProvider`
- Build atomic UI components that can be composed together

## Framework Design

This architecture was designed to provide:

1. **Reusability** - Services work across different UI implementations
2. **Testability** - Clear boundaries between logic and presentation
3. **Maintainability** - Changes to business logic don't affect UI
4. **Performance** - Reactive updates only re-render affected components
5. **Developer Experience** - Type-safe, predictable patterns
