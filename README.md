# Wix Kitchensink

A comprehensive showcase of Wix platform features with working implementations, interactive examples, and comprehensive documentation. Built with Astro, React, and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Members Management** - Complete authentication, profile management, and member data handling
- **File Uploads** - Profile photo upload with drag & drop support
- **Reactive Architecture** - Client-side services with headless components pattern
- **Server Integration** - Astro Actions for secure server-side operations
- **ðŸ“š Interactive Documentation** - Inline docs mode with component discovery
- **Wix Stores**: E-commerce functionality with product catalogs, shopping cart, and checkout
- **Wix Bookings**: Appointment scheduling and service management
- **React Router Store**: Single-page application demo with client-side routing

## ðŸ“š Interactive Documentation System

This project features a unique **docs mode** that lets you explore headless components directly within the application:

### How it Works

1. **Click the docs button** (ðŸ“„ icon) next to the navigation menu
2. **Enter docs mode** - headless components are highlighted with blue borders
3. **Click any highlighted component** to open its documentation in a drawer
4. **Browse discovered components** in the floating components list

### Features

- **Component Discovery** - Automatically finds and highlights headless components on each page
- **Real-time Documentation** - Click components to see their docs, props, and usage examples
- **Framework Documentation** - Comprehensive guides on the architecture and patterns
- **Implementation Examples** - See how components are used in real applications

### Documentation Sections

- **Architecture & Patterns** - Core concepts and design principles
- **Headless Components** - Individual component documentation with examples
- **Client-Side Services** - State management and business logic services
- **Examples & Use Cases** - Complete implementations and patterns

## Architecture

This project uses a unique **Client-Side Services & Headless Components** architecture:

### Client-Side Services

- Reactive state management using Signals
- Business logic encapsulation
- Server-side integration through Astro Actions
- Service dependencies and composition

### Headless Components

- Render prop pattern for maximum flexibility
- Complete separation of logic and presentation
- Composable and reusable across different UIs
- Type-safe interfaces throughout

### Benefits

- **Reusability** - Services work across different UI implementations
- **Testability** - Clear boundaries between logic and presentation
- **Maintainability** - Changes to business logic don't affect UI
- **Performance** - Reactive updates only re-render affected components

## React Router Implementation

The `/react-router` page demonstrates how to implement a single-page application using React Router for client-side navigation. This implementation includes:

### Features
- **Client-side routing** using React Router DOM
- **Nested routes** under `/react-router` base path:
  - `/react-router/store` - Product list with filters and search
  - `/react-router/products/:slug` - Product details page
  - `/react-router/cart` - Shopping cart with full functionality
- **Shared navigation** with active state indicators
- **Wix Services integration** with proper context management
- **Theme consistency** using Wix Vibe theme
- **Error boundaries** and loading states

### Route Structure
```
/react-router/
â”œâ”€â”€ store/          # Product catalog and filtering
â”œâ”€â”€ products/:slug  # Individual product details  
â””â”€â”€ cart/           # Shopping cart and checkout
```

### Key Implementation Details

#### **Architecture**
- **Single Astro page** (`/react-router`) with `client:only="react"` directive
- **React Router's BrowserRouter** with `basename="/react-router"`
- **WixServicesProvider** wrapping all routes for headless component functionality
- **StoreLayout** providing consistent navigation and styling
- **Conditional navigation** with React Router Link components for internal routing

#### **Component Adaptations**
- **CartRouter component**: React Router-compatible version of Cart with Link navigation
- **ProductDetails enhancement**: Accepts `cartUrl` prop for flexible cart navigation
- **ProductList integration**: Uses `productPageRoute` prop for correct product links

#### **Error Handling**
- **Loading fallback** while React Router initializes
- **404 handling** with automatic redirects to store
- **Product not found** with user-friendly error messages
- **Navigation breadcrumbs** showing current section

### Usage

Visit `/react-router` to experience the full single-page application with:
1. **Browse products** in the store section
2. **View product details** with full variant selection
3. **Add items to cart** and manage quantities
4. **Navigate seamlessly** without page reloads

This demonstrates how to integrate Wix headless components with modern React Router for building fast, interactive e-commerce experiences.

## Contributing

This project serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation. Contributions are welcome!

### Adding New Features

1. **Create the service** in `src/headless/[domain]/`
2. **Add headless components** using the render prop pattern
3. **Create documentation** in `src/pages/docs/`
4. **Add docs wrappers** for component discovery
5. **Update examples** and implementation guides

### Documentation

All headless components should include:

- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Usage examples with multiple scenarios
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Testing strategies and examples
